 You should include with your solution:
      • A sample of the output
Please find the unit tests for each problmes.
      • Why you chose the problems you did
I chose those problems based on the familarity of the concept
      • A description of the process you followed in solving the problem
First I whent through the list and randomly chose some problems and tried the solutions by hand. I tried almost 6 problems
 from the Project Euler site between 1-100. I challenged myself to take some very interesting problems, however
 among all those, I only chose to submit those scored 100% in HackerRank. HackerRank was helpful to test my solutions with
 various test cases. Afterward, I researched the internate for better or optimized solution for the problems. Each solution
 I found in the internate, I made sure the copy right and better execution time without compromising the quality of the code.
